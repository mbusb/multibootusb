"""
User Access Control for Microsoft Windows Vista and higher.  This is
only for the Windows platform.

This will relaunch either the current script - with all the same command
line parameters - or else you can provide a different script/program to
run.  If the current user doesn't normally have admin rights, he'll be
prompted for an admin password. Otherwise he just gets the UAC prompt.

This is meant to be used something like this::

    if not pyuac.isUserAdmin():
        return pyuac.runAsAdmin()

    # otherwise carry on doing whatever...

See L{runAsAdmin} for the main interface.

    (root on Unix), otherwise False.

    Warning: The inner function fails unless you have Windows XP SP2 or
    higher. The failure causes a traceback to be printed and this
    function to return False.
